// about the DSP changed in the move; the kit still runs it exactly as before.
//
// EACH STAGE IS INDEPENDENTLY GATED -- atkOn, susOn, crunch > 0, and the
// compressor's own amount -- which is what lets one instance carry a SINGLE
// stage with the others neutral, and be bit-identical to that stage inside the
// full bus. That property is the whole reason the effects module needs no new
// DSP: it is this struct with three of four knobs at zero.
//
// It was in an anonymous namespace, which cannot span translation units; it is
// in `dr32` now so both files name the same type.

     *  at softening — the whole lower half of the knob bought under 2 dB
     *  (measured -1.92 dB at 0.00, -0.10 dB at 0.375) against +8.54 dB at the
     *  top. That is structural, not tuning: Point boosts by DIVIDING the slow
     *  follower's rate (nibDiv/(1.001-x), which reaches 3.1x) and softens by
     *  MULTIPLYING it (nibDiv*(1.001-(0.75x)^2), which cannot get past 0.44x).
     *  The softening direction simply cannot travel.
     *
     *  So the detector is ours, and symmetric by construction: a fast peak
     *  follower, and a slow SMOOTHING of that follower. Their difference is
     *  large only while the fast one is outrunning the smoothed one, i.e. at an
     *  onset.
     *
     *  The smoothed follower is what makes this attack-only. During a decay it
     *  lags ABOVE the fast one, so the difference goes negative and clamps to
     *  zero — the tail is untouched. An earlier version used two followers with
     *  different ATTACKS and a shared release; that never reconverged, because
     *  two envelopes falling at the same exponential rate keep whatever gap
     *  they had, so its "transient" reading stayed constant through the decay
     *  and the stage became a broadband gain (measured: attack AND tail both
     *  moved together). */
